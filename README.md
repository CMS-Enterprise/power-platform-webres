# CMS Power Platform Web Resources

This repository contains source-controlled assets used by CMS Power Platform solutions, including Power Apps, Dataverse plugins, and dataflows.

## Organization

- `/apps/`  
  App-specific code and resources
- `/shared/`  
  Cross-app reusable components (when appropriate)

## Guiding principle

Code starts app-specific and becomes shared **only when reuse is proven**.

This approach favors clarity, safety, and maintainability over premature abstraction.
